## What I Do

I architect and build production systems where hardware constraints meet software scale—from embedded Linux video pipelines to full-stack web platforms. My work spans:

- Designing secure-by-design platform architectures for industrial IoT and edge devices
- Building V4L2/GStreamer-based video processing systems on embedded Linux (Yocto, PTXdist)
- Developing ERP-integrated workflow automation systems for manufacturing environments
- Leading full-stack development with modern web technologies (SvelteKit, TypeScript, PostgreSQL)
- Applying security-minded engineering practices aligned with OWASP standards
- Mentoring engineers and teaching programming fundamentals to underrepresented communities

---

## Core Domains

**Industrial Camera Systems** – Architecting embedded firmware and backend systems for real-time image capture, processing, and analysis on custom hardware platforms.

**Embedded Linux Video Pipelines** – Deep experience with V4L2, GStreamer, codec optimization, and kernel-space video subsystems for resource-constrained devices.

**Full-Stack Web Applications** – Building scalable, maintainable web platforms with SvelteKit, React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, focusing on developer experience and performance.

**Security Engineering** – Threat modeling, secure SDLC, IoT security (OWASP IoT Top 10), and hands-on penetration testing with Kali Linux toolchains.

**Workflow Automation & ERP Integration** – Connecting disparate business systems (Salesforce, Monday.com, Zebra printers) with resilient, auditable workflows for manufacturing and logistics.
